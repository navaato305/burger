The Eat-Da-Burger app featured on this page was built in two different ways: a version using sequelize and a version with a manual ORM system.  Both of these apps utilize a RESTful API and the handlebars template system.

Users of the application can create custom named burgers and submit them through the form.  They are added to the MySQL database.  All database queries are run through a custom built ORM.
